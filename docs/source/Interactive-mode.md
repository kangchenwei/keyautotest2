Interactive Mode
==================================================

With Golem the execution of a test can be paused at any point and start an interactive console that has all the Golem commands at disposal. This is extremely useful when writing and debugging tests.


#### Debug action

To start the interactive console at any point of a test just add the 'debug' action. Example:

**test.py**
```python

def test(data):
    navigate('http://wikipedia.org/')
    debug()
    click(page.button)
    capture('final screenshot')
```

When the test reaches the second step, the interactive console is going to start:


![interactive-console](_static/img/interactive-console.png "Interactive Console")


When the interactive console is terminated, the test will resume the execution from that point on.


<div class="admonition note">
    <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
    <p>If the test is not run with the -i flag, the debug actions will be ignored</p>
</div>


#### Quick Interactive Mode

It is posible to start a quick interactive mode by not providing a project and test to the run command:

```
golem run -i
```

This will start an interactive console with a clean slate.
